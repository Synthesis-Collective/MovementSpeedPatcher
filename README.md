# [Synthesis](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis) Movement Speed Patcher  
Aims to provide an easy-to-use framework for modifying **Movement Type** records (**MOVT**)
By using Synthesis, it supports _all_ Movement Type records from _all mods_ by adapting to your current load order, whatever it might be.

# Default Settings
By default, it will synchronize NPC & player walk/run speeds, and fix some vanilla inconsistencies.

# How to Get This Patcher
You can download the external patcher version on the Releases page of this repository, or you can get the full version by adding it through the Synthesis GUI's "Git Repository" button.
